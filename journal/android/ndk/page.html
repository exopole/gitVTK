<title>NDK</title>
</head><body>The NDK is a toolset that allows you to implement parts of your app using native-code languages such as C and C++. Typically, good use cases for the NDK are CPU-intensive applications such as game engines, signal processing, and physics simulation.<br/>
<br/>
Before downloading the NDK, you should understand that the NDK will not benefit most apps. As a developer, you need to balance its benefits against its drawbacks. Notably, using native code on Android generally does not result in a noticable performance improvement, but it always increases your app complexity. In general, you should only use the NDK if it is essential to your appâ€”never because you simply prefer to program in C/C++. When examining whether or not you should develop in native code, think about your requirements and see if the Android framework APIs provide the functionality that you need.<br/>
